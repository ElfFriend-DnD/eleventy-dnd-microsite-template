# A Dungeons and Dragons Microsite template repository

Implements 11ty via eleventy-base-blog. Reskins with a lightly trimmed homebrewery phb stylesheet.

The idea is to make an easy to spin up D&D Styled microsite + blog (session log) for a D&D group. The DM posts markdown files about their campaign primer, homebrew rules, and session logs into the right places and boom, a permanent site is deployed, easy to reference.
